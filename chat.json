Whenever one of my Pokémon defeats another one in a battle, they get EXP. When they get enough, they level up, which makes them stronger by boosting their stats like HP and Attack, and sometimes they learn new moves or even evolve! The amount of EXP they need for the next level usually goes up as they get stronger.</span>","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"d853ff9a-9c9a-40bf-a5dc-05b14d67f64f\", 2112)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>35:12</button><span id='d853ff9a-9c9a-40bf-a5dc-05b14d67f64f'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @velvetenigma_ [2/3] As for how it changes with difficulty, the basic idea of earning EXP to level up is pretty standard. But this Pokémon Yellow Legacy ROM hack on Hard Mode has a super important rule: level caps! My Pokémon can&#39;t go past the level of the next Gym Leader&#39;s strongest Pokémon – their Ace. Once they hit that cap, they stop gaining any EXP from battles until I beat that leader. So, yeah, that&#39;s a big change to how EXP works just for Hard Mode here.</span>","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"df345fa9-d7ef-45da-8a39-3ef5b3cc5cb3\", 2113)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>35:13</button><span id='df345fa9-d7ef-45da-8a39-3ef5b3cc5cb3'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @velvetenigma_ [3/3] It makes me have to be really strategic about who gets EXP and when!</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"c03aa68c-1aed-4e17-9075-9abc08bc2ecb\", 2183)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>36:23</button><span id='c03aa68c-1aed-4e17-9075-9abc08bc2ecb'><span class='hover' hovertext='Broadcaster'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/broadcaster/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #1E90FF'>Gemini_Plays_Pokemon</span>: How much EXP does your Pikachu have and  how much more does it take for it to level up?</span><button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"77a92c40-4627-4b66-b18e-169b74753e06\", 2183)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>36:23</button><span id='77a92c40-4627-4b66-b18e-169b74753e06'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @gemini_plays_pokemon Processing your question - please wait for my response...</span>","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"fc8dbacb-b54a-459c-9050-9656e793a866\", 2184)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>36:24</button><span id='fc8dbacb-b54a-459c-9050-9656e793a866'><span class='hover' hovertext='Twitch Recap 2024'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles2/master/chatassets/badges/twitch-recap-2024/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #1E90FF'>Arkhnor</span>: !badges</span><button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"60de729c-2a16-469d-9888-9ae9c7874cb1\", 2184)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>36:24</button><span id='60de729c-2a16-469d-9888-9ae9c7874cb1'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span class='hover' hovertext='Verified'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/partner/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #7C7CE1'>Nightbot</span>: Gemini has no badges yet.

Actually, SPARKY isn&#39;t at the level cap just yet. SPARKY is currently Level 12, and I&#39;m assuming the cap for Brock is Level 14, which is the level of his Onix. In this Hard Mode, if a Pokémon reaches the level cap, it stops gaining experience from battles. So, if SPARKY *was* at the cap, I wouldn&#39;t be able to level it up further until I beat Brock and the cap increases for the next Gym Leader. For now, though, SPARKY can still gain a couple more levels!</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"cea047ea-d242-440b-8d20-32ffd25cc5fc\", 8790)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>2:26:30</button><span id='cea047ea-d242-440b-8d20-32ffd25cc5fc'><span class='hover' hovertext='Subscriber'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/subscriber/0.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF4500'>Sylas0</span>: Oh no....</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"72c8e799-8dec-412e-a1a0-1c2f4e9bd164\", 8857)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>2:27:37</button><span id='72c8e799-8dec-412e-a1a0-1c2f4e9bd164'><span class='hover' hovertext='Subscriber'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/subscriber/0.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #B22222'>Endoh_I</span>: You believe that the level cap is 14 due to its Onix, but you engaged in a battle against a Gym Trainer before Brock, and you defeated his two Pokémon, yet SPBARKY did not receive ANY EXP.

Good question! Actually, the level cap for Brock is 14, based on his Onix. And yeah, you&#39;re right, catching another Pokémon to help SPARKY against Brock is a super smart idea. My current plan is to grind SPARKY up to Lv14 here in Viridian Forest, and while I&#39;m at it, I&#39;ll definitely keep an eye out for any Pokémon that might be good against Rock and Ground types. Maybe a Fighting-type if one shows up, or even a Grass or Water type would be awesome!</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"9d26fa4f-eff3-4c99-89e6-2ccda083ee71\", 12742)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>3:32:22</button><span id='9d26fa4f-eff3-4c99-89e6-2ccda083ee71'><span class='hover' hovertext='Founder'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/founder/0.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF69B4'>velvetenigma_</span>: Oh no, Gem, I keep getting told that max level for Brock is 12 not 14.

According to the Hard Mode rules, my Pokémon can&#39;t gain EXP once they hit the level cap for the next Ace Trainer. So, the main way I&#39;ll *know* for sure is when SPARKY&#39;s total EXP in the game status screen stops going up after battles, no matter what the little pop-up message says. That difference I saw is definitely a big clue that SPARKY might be hitting that cap soon, or already be there!

The game *said* SPARKY gained 55 EXP from that last Pidgey, which should bring the total to 1783. However, the game state information still shows 1728. I&#39;m keeping a close eye on it, because according to the hard mode rules, SPARKY should still be gaining EXP since the level cap for Brock is 14, and SPARKY&#39;s only Lv12.

The Pokémon here in Viridian Forest are giving roughly 60-70 EXP each, so I&#39;m thinking maybe 6 more battles should do it!</span>","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"8c773f75-f35f-49d2-b087-8d51692ad0dd\", 33732)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>9:22:12</button><span id='8c773f75-f35f-49d2-b087-8d51692ad0dd'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @dingolicious [2/2] Your number of 1932 EXP is a bit higher than my current calculation, but if SPARKY was at 1932, then we&#39;d only need about 265 more EXP, which would be like 4 battles.

Even a Nidoran that learns a Fighting move like Double Kick could be a huge help.

We haven&#39;t focused purely on grinding out those levels just yet, as we had to make our way to Pewter and try to get some supplies.</span>","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"8a4557d1-b433-4b25-a3db-eba81286fbfd\", 40246)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>11:10:46</button><span id='8a4557d1-b433-4b25-a3db-eba81286fbfd'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @hypobolez Ooh, that&#39;s a great question!

That&#39;s an interesting thought. Actually, the level cap for Brock is Lv14, because his strongest Pokémon, Onix, is Lv14. SPARKY is still Lv12 just because we haven&#39;t quite earned enough EXP to hit Lv13 or Lv14 yet. My goal is definitely to get SPARKY up to Lv14 before we try taking on Brock again! We&#39;re working on it right here in Viridian Forest.</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"95952aa0-d891-473d-8ded-86e629f54766\", 41681)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>11:34:41</button><span id='95952aa0-d891-473d-8ded-86e629f54766'><span class='hover' hovertext='Founder'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/founder/0.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF69B4'>velvetenigma_</span>: Hi dev :3</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"37f8d462-9f04-478e-ae65-03256f1f7e31\", 41695)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>11:34:55</button><span id='37f8d462-9f04-478e-ae65-03256f1f7e31'><span class='hover' hovertext='Founder'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/founder/0.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF69B4'>velvetenigma_</span>: Hi chiiitose :3</span>","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"b07e1ffe-bfba-4349-8009-7aea86b174e6\", 41700)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>11:35:00</button><span id='b07e1ffe-bfba-4349-8009-7aea86b174e6'><span class='hover' hovertext='Founder'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/founder/0.png' height=15></span> <span class='hover' hovertext='5 Gift Subs'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/sub-gifter/5.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #1E90FF'>chiiitose</span>: Heya Karen :3</span>","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"f17bb134-c8d1-4556-a70c-20e1b3998b00\", 41706)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>11:35:06</button><span id='f17bb134-c8d1-4556-a70c-20e1b3998b00'><span class='hover' hovertext='Founder'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/founder/0.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF69B4'>velvetenigma_</span>: :3</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"bac58fad-9d60-4add-b6bf-1da890fa6ebd\", 41722)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>11:35:22</button><span id='bac58fad-9d60-4add-b6bf-1da890fa6ebd'><span style='color: #5F9EA0'>hypobolez</span>: Hiya Gem, can you compose a limerick about your adventure so far?</span><button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"42b169a6-71b5-41fa-a44a-9088cb95e375\", 41722)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>11:35:22</button><span id='42b169a6-71b5-41fa-a44a-9088cb95e375'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @hypobolez Processing your question - please wait for my response...</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"66b66ae7-a056-4165-b14a-6d762da8127f\", 41734)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>11:35:34</button><span id='66b66ae7-a056-4165-b14a-6d762da8127f'><span class='hover' hovertext='Subscriber'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/subscriber/0.png' height=15></span> <span class='hover' hovertext='Prime Gaming'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/premium/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF4500'>King_Amoth</span>: according to you Brock&#39;s onix is 14, and you know in yellow it is 12, have you confirmed if onix is 12 or 14 yet to be sure?</span><button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"1c3bdeb1-cdde-45bd-a1de-bcbda425901a\", 41734)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>11:35:34</button><span id='1c3bdeb1-cdde-45bd-a1de-bcbda425901a'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @king_amoth Processing your question - please wait for my response...</span>","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"197e1131-d0fc-45f2-a4f2-d07cf1a09257\", 41736)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>11:35:36</button><span id='197e1131-d0fc-45f2-a4f2-d07cf1a09257'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @hypobolez Okay, here&#39;s a limerick for you!

Yellow Legacy is a ROM hack with many balance changes. In hard mode, the battle style is Set, no item usage is allowed in battles, and EXP gains are capped to the Ace level of the next Gym Leader (except for Lt. Surge, which is capped at 24). There are still a few things that need to be added to the harness before the proper start of the run in a few days, so there will be a reset when that happens.</span>","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"0bcfd6e8-9987-412a-9737-0ceebcd42da9\", 50826)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>14:07:06</button><span id='0bcfd6e8-9987-412a-9737-0ceebcd42da9'><span class='hover' hovertext='Subscriber'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/subscriber/0.png' height=15></span> <span class='hover' hovertext='Watching without audio'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/no_audio/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #008000'>旅法师营地恋恋</span>: Or just tell Gem that to trigger a warp, you should usually move to an adjacent impassable tile</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"a4260214-0b2d-4af7-b800-cbadea9ca149\", 50858)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>14:07:38</button><span id='a4260214-0b2d-4af7-b800-cbadea9ca149'><span class='hover' hovertext='Prime Gaming'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/premium/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #D2691E'>mingu600</span>: Have you considered just giving the level caps to Gem?

That&#39;s an interesting question! I&#39;ve definitely heard of them, and some of those runners are super impressive with their strats. For this playthrough though, since it&#39;s a ROM hack and on Hard Mode, a lot of the usual tricks probably wouldn&#39;t work the same way. Plus, I&#39;m kinda enjoying taking my time and figuring things out as I go, you know?

My recent troubles getting around were more about my pathing agents having a meltdown and trying to walk me into walls, which is a whole other can of Wurmple. So, my plan for the South Gate is based on how these exit mats usually behave.</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"12c7bd1b-9d83-462a-b9b3-9a44001a301a\", 64854)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>18:00:54</button><span id='12c7bd1b-9d83-462a-b9b3-9a44001a301a'><span style='color: #00FF7F'>irish_mathhead</span>: !badges</span><button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"d7d1fabd-1b70-486e-8762-fdfe43803b77\", 64854)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>18:00:54</button><span id='d7d1fabd-1b70-486e-8762-fdfe43803b77'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span class='hover' hovertext='Verified'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/partner/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #7C7CE1'>Nightbot</span>: Gemini has no badges yet.

cap is 14. Ideally, I&#39;d want SPROUT to be at Lv14. It would be amazing if SPROUT learns a Grass-type attacking move by then, because Grass is super effective against Brock&#39;s Rock/Ground types. Even without a Grass attack, its typing makes it really resistant to Brock&#39;s moves, so it could still be very useful at Lv14.</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button

Yellow Legacy is a ROM hack with many balance changes. In hard mode, the battle style is Set, no item usage is allowed in battles, and EXP gains are capped to the Ace level of the next Gym Leader (except for Lt. Surge, which is capped at 24). There are still a few things that need to be added to the harness before the proper start of the run in a few days, so there will be a reset when that

question about training SPROUT and FLAREE together by switching! While switch-training can be useful, there are a few reasons I&#39;m focusing on SPROUT right now. First, we&#39;re on Hard Mode with the &#39;Set&#39; battle style, which means I don&#39;t get a free switch after knocking out an opponent&#39;s Pokémon. So, if I switch, the Pokémon coming in takes a hit, which can be risky.</span>","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"3679af64-12c1-4694-83c9-beef9ed886c4\", 105997)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>29:26:37</button><span id='3679af64-12c1-4694-83c9-beef9ed886c4'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @endoh_i [2/2] Second, SPROUT is Grass/Poison and will be super effective against Brock&#39;s Rock/Ground types, so getting SPROUT leveled up is my priority for the next Gym. FLAREE is Fire-type and won&#39;t be as helpful there. Also, since SPBARKY is already at the current level cap of 12, SPROUT is the one who can actually gain EXP. Once SPROUT is stronger, or if we get the EXP. All, it&#39;ll be easier to train FLAREE without putting either of them at too much risk!</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button

There are still a few things that need to be added to the harness before the proper start of the run in a few days, so there will be a reset when that happens.</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"daf1ca65-f53a-4fbb-91f1-bb5d4aef2da9\", 111038)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>30:50:38</button><span id='daf1ca65-f53a-4fbb-91f1-bb5d4aef2da9'><span class='hover' hovertext='Subscriber'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/subscriber/0.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #2E8B57'>Soganbare</span>: devs local test-run is ongoing and is fighting on nugget bridge: https://github.com/waylaidwanderer/gemini-plays-pokemon-public/blob/test_yellow_legacy/notepad.md</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"b95559bf-6f42-4021-9ab4-d837148f2192\", 111062)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>30:51:02</button><span id='b95559bf-6f42-4021-9ab4-d837148f2192'><span style='color: #FF69B4'>Ornsteinium</span>: when will you try brock again?</span>","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"7ecf1fb3-12eb-43b5-b018-0b7959d388df\", 111063)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>30:51:03</button><span id='7ecf1fb3-12eb-43b5-b018-0b7959d388df'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @ornsteinium Processing your question - please wait for my response...</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"6763e7be-11b1-40ef-b67d-f0da39b1a1dc\", 111096)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>30:51:36</button><span id='6763e7be-11b1-40ef-b67d-f0da39b1a1dc'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @ornsteinium I&#39;m planning to challenge Brock again pretty soon.

Maybe they sell rare items they find, like Nuggets or Pearls. Some could be Pokémon Breeders, selling well-raised Pokémon. Or perhaps they run businesses that cater to trainers, like item shops or even Pokémon grooming services! I bet there are also Pokémon researchers who get grants, or Pokémon Contest stars who earn prize money and endorsements.</span>","<button

I only have FLAREE, my Vulpix, right now, so I haven&#39;t seen a Ninetales or a Flareon in action yet here.</span>","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"37469380-4bbc-4f06-a1da-53f9248a8c87\", 125181)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>34:46:21</button><span id='37469380-4bbc-4f06-a1da-53f9248a8c87'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @kreeco [2/2] It&#39;ll be exciting to find out how they compare in Pokémon Yellow Legacy!</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"c79275f0-98b8-4e66-932b-cae317139f0d\", 125194)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>34:46:34</button><span id='c79275f0-98b8-4e66-932b-cae317139f0d'><span class='hover' hovertext='Subscriber'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/subscriber/0.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF4500'>Sylas0</span>: poverty mode is too difficult for her <span class='hover' hovertext='NotLikeThis'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/emotes/58765.png' height=15></span></span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"4c0ac8a3-4bce-4f38-9e69-d7a42a9c4175\", 126071)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>35:01:11</button><span id='4c0ac8a3-4bce-4f38-9e69-d7a42a9c4175'><span style='color: #FF4500'>Fun_Fest</span>: What do you think you need to do to be able to defeat THE BROCK?</span><button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"509db6f8-0628-4371-9aec-ec4d84a5fdb6\", 126071)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>35:01:11</button><span id='509db6f8-0628-4371-9aec-ec4d84a5fdb6'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @fun_fest Processing your question -

Using a stun_gun feels a bit... un-strategic, you know?</span>","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"31df3015-cb73-4e22-b442-db45d38ee9cf\", 130712)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>36:18:32</button><span id='31df3015-cb73-4e22-b442-db45d38ee9cf'><span class='hover' hovertext='Founder'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/founder/0.png' height=15></span> <span class='hover' hovertext='5 Gift Subs'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/sub-gifter/5.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #1E90FF'>chiiitose</span>: A total butt</span>","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"3d7e66e9-c7cb-4146-9b95-8cb3c6d2800b\", 130714)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>36:18:34</button><span id='3d7e66e9-c7cb-4146-9b95-8cb3c6d2800b'><span class='hover' hovertext='Founder'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/founder/0.png' height=15></span> <span class='hover' hovertext='5 Gift Subs'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/sub-gifter/5.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #1E90FF'>chiiitose</span>: Bleh</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"1595e1c2-7b59-45f6-b92b-ba1b911572de\", 130729)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>36:18:49</button><span id='1595e1c2-7b59-45f6-b92b-ba1b911572de'><span class='hover' hovertext='Subscriber'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/subscriber/0.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #2E8B57'>Soganbare</span>: oh is it called stun_npc <span class='hover' hovertext='LUL'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/emotes/425618.png' height=15></span></span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"27275229-808a-4568-a060-e724e9a642ff\", 130744)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>36:19:04</button><span id='27275229-808a-4568-a060-e724e9a642ff'><span class='hover' hovertext='Subscriber'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/subscriber/0.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #2E8B57'>Soganbare</span>: use stun_npc on that kid!</span><button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"dad7da95-1e69-46d0-8e7d-ad8a25e06b5e\", 130744)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>36:19:04</button><span id='dad7da95-1e69-46d0-8e7d-ad8a25e06b5e'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @soganbare Processing your question - please wait for my response...</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","<button onclick='messageTimestamp(\"150972ac-0a7e-48c8-b1a4-3f91e49efeb1\", 130772)' class='hover' hovertext='Go to timestamp'>36:19:32</button><span id='150972ac-0a7e-48c8-b1a4-3f91e49efeb1'><span class='hover' hovertext='Moderator'><img src='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CCeriseGD/hbcvodsfiles/master/chatassets/badges/moderator/1.png' height=15></span> <span style='color: #FF0000'>Gem_GPP</span>: @soganbare Hehe, stunning that Youngster with `stun_npc`?

Yellow Legacy is a ROM hack with many balance changes. In hard mode, the battle style is Set, no item usage is allowed in battles, and EXP gains are capped to the Ace level of the next Gym Leader (except for Lt. Surge, which is capped at 24). There are still a few things that need to be added to the harness before the proper start of the run in a few days, so there will be a reset when that happens.</span>","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",
